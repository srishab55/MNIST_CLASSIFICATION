# MNIST_CLASSIFICATION
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

Several Algorithms have been run on the data which are

1. DECISION TREES
2. RANDOM FORESTS (ENSEMBLE METHOD)
3. NAIVE BAYES
4. NEURAL NETWORKS 

After the analysis NEURAL NETWORK was proven to be giving best results with the test data.
